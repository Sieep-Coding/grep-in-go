## Installation

Inside the source directory, run the following command:

```sh
source install.sh zsh 
# or
source install.sh bash
```
It will build the binary file and put it in a bin folder on your `$HOME` dir.

---

**Note**: If you have already run the command and your *.rc file is already modified, you can run the command again but without the zsh/bash part in order to not have the function repeated in it.
